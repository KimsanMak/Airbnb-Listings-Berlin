# Airbnb-Listings-Berlin

## Overview
This repository contains some examples of Python scripts e.g. supervised ML regression that I used to analyse data from the Airbnb listings in Berlin.

## Objective
Identify the features of a house or apartment in Berlin that customers find important when considering to rent it. The findings can serve as guidance for potential renters and way to maximize the value of their properties.

Key questions to be answered:
1. How many Airbnb listings are there in Berlin?
2. What kind od properties are listed?
3. Where are the listed properties? and where are the popular districtss?
4. What features of the apartment or room are important for rentees?
5. What prices are the different properties?
   
## Data
The data sets contain 2 files; one file, [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/berlin/), contains information on all the listings in Berlin. It contains information like location, rating, price, attraction index, and restaurant index. A second file, [Airbnb Prices in European Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities), is a data scrapped from Airbnb and was downloaded from kabble. This file contains	information on cleanliness, distance from metro, distance from city center, and guest satisfaction.

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following libraries:
+ Matplotlib: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ Numpy: performing mathematical operations on arrays
+ Pandas: organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data
+ Seaborn: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ SciPy: broader spectrum of scientific tools, algorithms, and functions
